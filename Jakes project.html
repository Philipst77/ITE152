<p>This beautiful video right here shows Lil Baby talking about his life and his everyday activities. 
It also mentions the way that Lil Baby talks, which helps promote his discography. Leading to him being
a generational talent, inspiring the youth and dropping many magnificent party anthems and classics that 
we all know and love. To mention a few, we have "Freestyle," "Errbody," "Stand on It," "Close Friends," and "In a Minute,"
 which are all heartfelt classics that the youth know and love. </p>
